Premade configurations to generate binaries, static libraries, and Shared Object files

### Use cases

For use in
- small projects
- Multiple projects in one work space
- Projects that link to each other

the same subdir.

If you want a static library instead use "Makefile.prj.a" or "Makefile.prj.so" for a shared object file
